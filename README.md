# TodoAzure
This is a simple todo app made for learning how to work with Azure.
Project follows clean ariteture, Blazor used for UI, WEB API for communication between Client and Server, C# for server with EFC interacting with database.

The plan is:

  1. Hosting a Server SQL database.

  2. Hosting a business server that interactes with set database.

  3. Hosting a website interacting with set business server.

All done with Azure



Future goals will be learning how to update these resources through dev Ops and pipelining, but that is not yet something i have started conquering.
